# Simon Project
##Overview

For WDI project 1 I built a remake of the classic Simon game.

After the site loads the player is presented with a colorful interface with very little text. I purposefully kept the amount of text and instruction minimal to present the user with a clean, flat, user-friendly interface. To begin the user pushes the green button. After the green button is pressed a tile lights up and the user must repeat the computer's selection. This process continues with an additional tile added to the sequence each time. There is no winning condition, instead the user is trying to beat the current high score that is displayed on the top left of the page. The game ends and restarts at level 0 any time the player makes an incorrect choice or presses the red reset button.
